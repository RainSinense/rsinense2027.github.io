          The first place our food arrives in is of course our mouth. Inside our
          mouth is the saliva, which helps in lubricating the food we intake to
          which also helps in our digestion. After the food gets lubricated
          inside the mouth, it then goes through the esophagus until it reaches
          the stomach. The stomach then breaks down the food with the gastric
          acid present inside it.

          Now, after our body digests the food we eat, our body will finally
          excrete the excess wastes left in our body. While excreting these
          wastes, our body also excretes out the waste fluids in our body.
          Similar to the solid wastes in our body, these waste fluids that goes
          inside our body has to go though absorption so that our body would be
          able to absorb the nutrients in it. While we excrete these wastes,
          there can still be extra wastes that can be left out inside our body
          which is why it is professionally removed in some instances. This
          excretion of solid wastes out of our body can only be done in our anus
          and nowhere else. Finally, after these cycles, the wastes will finally
          reach the outside of our body aka the “outside world”.

          The tissue with 4 folds absorbed more water. That is due to its
          greater surface area which mimics the inner walls of the small
          intestine to better absorb nutrients into our bloodstream

          In the video, the dishwashing liquid, water, and oil are mixed
          together. Wherein the oil become small droplets at the end. It is
          possible thanks to the addition of the dishwashing liquid that
          simulates the bile in mechanically digesting fats into smaller
          droplets or particles to help the small intestine in absorbing them.

          This activity was able to help us visualize more about how our body
          digests the foods we intake. We were also able to understand how each
          of our organs work in our digestive cycle. As we were able to learn in
          our activity, our body is actually able to both absorb nutrients and
          excrete wastes out of it. This information actually helps us
          undertsand more about what and how we can take care of our body. We
          now know that it is dangerous for our body to have too much of
          soemthing so we must be able to control ourselves whne it comes to
          eating unhealthy foods. This activity was also able to contribute to
          our understanding of what is going on inside our body. Overall, this
          acticity of the simulation of our digestive system gives us the
          knowledge about our body and how we can take care of it.
